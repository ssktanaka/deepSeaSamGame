### Overview of Gameplay

Help Hootie the Pufferfish navigate the ocean floor and find his way home. Dodge the perils of the ocean deepâ€”swift-moving sharks, ink-spewing squids, and bubbling, fiery underwater volcanoes. Don't get too close, or Hootie will blow up in shock.

Collect shrimp and shells along the way to earn points and keep Hootie nimble. Aim for a new high score each time you play.
